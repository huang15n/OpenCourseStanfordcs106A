 * Purpose :  this game is designed to have the name that user given 
 * and the name will be designed to be a song with rythm 
 * the trick to do so is know how to do the name separation properly 
 * and extract the name to get this out of and turn it into proper position 
 * if you put hello 
 * it will get you hheelllloo

	 * precondition : this method takes a string and circle the whole string ,each element in the string will be extract ,and concatenated with its character doubled 
	 * postcondition : it should print out things with pattern like each element doubled 
	 * algorithm : you extract the string individually ,to start off ,what is the loop is the key 
	 * one approach to do this is that ,you will have to know that the length of the string ,which is the length of the loop 
	 * then you loop through the string ,each element cancatenate twice . 
	 * similar to the cumulative sum method ,set an original empty string and collect the double
