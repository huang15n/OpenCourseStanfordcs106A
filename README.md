# Summary
this is the practice code for writting Stanford CS course cs106A -- programming methodologies, where enriches my knowledge of object oriented notions. The most renown Stanford's free Open Course Series cs106A programming methodology, CS106B programming abstraction, CS107 programming paradigms launched in ITunes in the year 2008 provides many novice or people without programming experience with the significant introduction of computer science and programming principles. 

# Introduction 
the codes attached follows entirely assignment instruction provided in the course website that helps students to understand how the basic notion of programming works including data types, variables, the logic process like loops and conditional. Furthermore, it enlightens more advanced topics such as Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Interface. Stanford was dedicated to provide the best CS course to the whole world that people can learn from anywhere 

# Desclaimer
The learning material and intellecual properties belong to Stanford. While the code is the learning process and personal accomplishment showing progresses, which is not intended for any commercial use. Feel free to refer to it but it is not guaranteed to be correct.

# Personal Statement 
While I was close to the end of the entire series, the most interesting part was the graphical user interface assignment called Breakout game which was originally made by Steve Wozinik in last centry. By using stanfords graphical librarys and function, I touched upon the concept of class, therefore, how to construct the entire brick class in the game that shows the attribute(brick size and coordinates in the screen) and behaviour (it wil disppear after the ball hits it and so on). Inheritance, what if the programmer wants to customize the bricks in various attributes but without rewrite the code while just enhance the functionality. Polymorphism, is there any possibility that the subclass could work as the super class just by super class methods? Interfaces, all bricks will be sharing with same protocol and the other programmer know what to put if they intend to use the interface.
